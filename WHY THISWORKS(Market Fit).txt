Problem,Aura Solves It
Dating apps are full of catfish,Blockchain verification = trust
Matches feel random,"AI learns real preferences, not just looks"
Users don’t trust apps,Transparency + ownership via blockchain
Apps aren’t cross-platform,One app works everywhere — no app store dependency
Hard to monetize,Multiple high-margin digital products (not just subscriptions)
